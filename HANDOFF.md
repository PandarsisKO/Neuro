# HANDOFF — shared Codex / Claude delivery mechanics

## Start here

1. Find every `STATE-OF-THE-APP-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`; read the newest timestamp.
2. Read `DEVELOPMENT-OPERATING-SYSTEM.md` for Kyle's governing workflow, and `CLAUDE.md` for standing invariants.
3. Read `FOUNDATION-HANDOFF.md` for changes, validation, delivery status and the exact restart point.
4. Read only the active rung and relevant tests/HARDENING entries. `PRODUCT-SCHEDULER.md` owns priorities.

The active program is Transcript Intelligence, admitted after the completed Foundation closeout. External AI access,
expanded Research/Discover/Planner, additional Bootstrap and unrelated Findings redesign are parked. Old declarations
of a current mission are historical evidence only.

Current execution state: Foundation 0.63.43 is release-checked at `bf8d595`; the active T1 slice is release-checked
on the current T1 commit chain. R7 adds project-relative embedding
comparison to R6 scheduling and Findings reading: redundant material receives a bounded priority reduction, while
its least-similar residual chunks are read first. This never removes a source or kept window; missing/corrupt vectors
leave existing order unchanged. Full pytest, Tier 1 and release-check pass. The authenticated closeout observation
also found a clean queue, healthy integrity/backup state and interactive endpoint p90 at or below 0.58s. T1 is
implemented through corpus attestation, versioned derived-vector storage, fail-open measurement helpers, and a
read-only cohort in the existing production `text-embedding-3-small` space. R9(a)'s selected local `bge-m3` result is 34.48
ms p50, recall@10 1.0000 and MRR 0.8898; it is reserved for a later full-space migration gate. R9(b) is now complete: Llama 3.1 8B
clears the short-classification gate and the other declared candidates are rejected. R9(c)'s long-window benchmark
is explicitly deferred with a numeric revisit trigger. R8 retention is deliberately deferred to its non-destructive observation trigger after
2026-10-11 17:28 PT and is non-blocking. Existing production chunks remain
unchanged; the remaining T1 gate is the explicitly authorized derived-object backfill and semantic cohort. See `PRODUCT-SCHEDULER.md`,
`docs/PRE-T1-GATE-AUDIT-2026-09-12.md` and `docs/T1-ADMISSION-2026-09-12.md`.

GitHub custody: the current documentation tree is published on `https://github.com/PandarsisKO/Neuro` and the latest
compact sync was verified tree-equal to this checkout. The published snapshot includes the Foundation R7 closeout,
R9(a)/(b) scorecards, the T1 vector-space reconciliation, the R8 revisit trigger, the Claude handoff, and the
reproducible R9(c) continuation chain. Re-run the compact sync after any future tracked documentation change.
`VIDEOS/`, `data/` and `_to_delete/` remain absent from tracked files.

## Shared checkout and coordination

The Mac checkout is `/Users/kyleowen/Desktop/2026 - KO Neuro Search REPO`. Codex works directly on this Mac; historical VM/device-bridge/tar delivery instructions DO NOT apply here. Claude was dormant when Kyle confirmed coordination on 2026-09-11.

Before editing, inspect current Git state and the Foundation handoff. Record the base commit, isolation path and touched files. Before delivery, compare against that base; preserve other changes and reconcile overlap instead of overwriting it. Never reset, broadly stage, remove Git locks, or delete files as a delivery shortcut. Do not assume a clean tree solely because an older handoff says so.

Current custody note: the compact GitHub tree is protected and `git ls-files 'VIDEOS/**'` returns zero files. A
zero-byte `.git/index.lock` held by the macOS Virtualization VM process released at 16:08 PT; no Git process was
associated, the real index was reconciled to `HEAD`, and no lock is present now. The recordings remain on local disk
and are excluded from Git/GitHub. Do not add `VIDEOS/`, `data/` or `_to_delete/` to a snapshot.

The worktree contains a preserved, uncommitted Claude-side Bootstrap, resources, UI and test set
(`neurosearch/bootstrap.py`, `neurosearch/resources.py`, `neurosearch/web/index.html`, `tests/test_k3_resources.py`,
`tests/test_s14_fix_pass.py`); its focused suite is 73 passed. Do not stage or overwrite that set while continuing
R9/T1. Additional untracked Claude/design material is present in `AUDIT.md`, `design.md`,
`Claude outputs/T1-DESIGN-AUDIT-2026-09-12.md`, and `INSPIRATION/`; preserve it and review it as one coherent set
before touching the same surfaces. The tracked copy of Claude's design audit is
`docs/T1-DESIGN-AUDIT-2026-09-12.md`.

## Protect the live app

Never open or copy the live `data/neurosearch.db`, even read-only. Never delete it. Never run tests, doctor, eval, release-check or a second server against it. Use the running app's supported API for observations. For raw SQL use a verified backup copied into a private temporary workspace, never the original backup in place.

Prepare runtime changes in an isolated checkout/copy without `.env`, `data`, cookies or media. Set a private temporary `NEUROSEARCH_DATA_DIR` for commands. Tests use deterministic fakes and private databases; live provider work must have a justified measurement and explicit cost/transport decision. Do not change Kyle's `.env` to make a test pass.

Runtime files are watched by the live server. Landing them can interrupt active work. Prepare the exact tested change and handoff first; delivery approval, where needed, is the final step. Kyle does no terminal work. A restart needed for recovery must use the existing double-clickable launcher or be performed by the agent with authorization, never assigned as shell commands to Kyle.

## Validation and release

During development run affected tests plus touched invariant gates. At a release boundary run full pytest, Tier 1, release-check, and check version agreement (`neurosearch/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, UI_VERSION). All commands operate in the isolated workspace. Test failures must be diagnosed rather than repeatedly rerun until green.

Record the actual command, result, environment, candidate source hash, and artifact paths. A previous PASS is not evidence for edited code. An artifact marked `nogit` is historical evidence without commit binding; new artifacts must identify the tested candidate and its base. Do not call code released merely because it was written or tests passed. Record prepared, delivered, committed/tagged and live-verified separately.

Rung evidence belongs in HARDENING.md and current state/handoff documents. Do not append new work to archived EXPANSION.md. Preserve frozen baselines; changes require explicit measured justification. Browser behavior and M3 Max/provider performance require their own verification.

## Returning to suspended work

Answer: what did intervening work benefit, hinder, invalidate or add risk to? Compare touched surfaces and assumptions, write a Resume Delta, and run intersection gates before continuing. Do not mechanically resume a historical checklist.

The prior handoff is retained in `docs/archive/HANDOFF-2026-09-11-pre-foundation.md` for history only.
